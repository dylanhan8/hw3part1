        <h1>The History of the New England Patriots</h1>

        <section>
            <p>The New England Patriots are a professional football team based in the Greater Boston area. Their stadium, Gillette Stadium, is located in Foxborough, Massachusetts. The team is one of the most successful teams in the NFL, tied for the league record in Super Bowl championships with six. The team was founded in 1959, and was most recently sold to current owner Robert Kraft in 1994. </p>
            <p>The team is known for their iconic red, white, and blue uniforms and Flying Elvis and Pat Patriot logos. The patriots dynasty of the 21st century featured an unprecedented run of success, where the team dominated the league for 2 decades. At the helm of this success was the pairing of head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady, the best to ever do it at their respective positions.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, Tom Brady left the team at the conclusion of the 2019 to 2020 season. Since 2020, the patriots have not been a very good team. They have had only one winning record since then, and have gone through multiple quarterbacks in their quest to replace Tom Brady. After the 2023 to 2024 season, head coach Bill Belichick was let go, and Jerod Mayo was picked as his successor. A new quarterback, Drake Maye, was selected third overall in the draft to hopefully succeed in replacing Brady.</p>
